# DS2500 Project: Terrestrial Biodiversity Protection Analysis

## Overview
This project, completed in the Fall of 2024 with partners Maygala and Samara, examines terrestrial biodiversity protection measures across high-risk regions. It aggregates data from three environmental datasets and applies correlation algorithms to quantify relationships between regions.
